# Info 201 Final - World Happiness
> This project is a data analysis of 2015 - 2017 World Happiness Report data. The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness from the Gallup World Poll. The happiness score estimates the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. Click through the different data analyses of factors we did - you can sort them by year and region.
